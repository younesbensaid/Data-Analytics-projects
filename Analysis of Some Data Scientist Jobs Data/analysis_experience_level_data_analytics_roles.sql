NOTE:
The experience levels distribution presented in this analysis reflects
only the data available in the current dataset I am working with. This
distribution is not necessarily an accurate or comprehensive
representation of the actual labor market or the true distribution of
experience levels in analytics roles in general. 


Description:
This query groups data analytics roles by job_title and
experience_level to calculate the number of positions and summarize  
salary details for each group. It also aggregates data by 
experience_level to show total positions and salary statistics per level.

Purpose:
To provide a clear breakdown of how roles are distributed across 
experience levels, along with salary summaries for each job title–
experience combination and for each experience level overall.

Steps:
grouping by (job_title + experience_level)
and counting the total position for each group,
and the salaries details
AND EXPORT IT TO CSV IN 
Dataset/exprience-levels-related-to-data-analytics-roles-by-group.csv

AND THEN calculating the total positions for each exprience level,
and the salaries details for each experince level
AND EXPORT IT TO CSV FILE IN
Dataset/total_positions-for-each-experience-level.csv
