# Analysis of Some Data Scientist Jobs Data

## Project Overview

> **Note:** The results presented in this analysis are based solely on the dataset used in this project and do not necessarily reflect real-world trends.

This project focuses on analyzing **Data Scientist jobs** using data from Kaggle.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Downloaded a dataset of Data Scientist jobs from Kaggle in CSV format.

2. **Database Setup**
   - Created an empty table in a local PostgreSQL database.
   - Imported the CSV data into the database for further analysis.

3. **Data Inspection**
   - Inspected all values in each column to identify irregular or unexpected entries.
   - Checked for inconsistent formatting and spelling of values.

4. **Data Selection**
   - Extracted all records related to **Data Analytics roles**.
   - Exported the filtered dataset into a CSV file.

5. **Analysis by Job Title and Experience Level**
   - Grouped data analytics roles by `job_title` and `experience_level`.
   - Calculated the number of positions and summarized salary details for each group.
   - Aggregated results by experience level to show total positions and salary statistics.
   - Exported the results to CSV files.

6. **Analysis by Job Title and Employment Type**
   - Grouped data analytics roles by `job_title` and `employment_type`.
   - Calculated the number of positions and summarized salary details for each group.
   - Aggregated results by employment type to show total positions and salary details for each type.
   - Exported the results to  CSV files.

7. **Salary Range Analysis**
   - Analyzed salaries within data analytics roles by defining salary brackets.
   - Summarized the number of positions across these ranges.
   - Exported the results to a CSV file.

8. **Analysis by Job Title and Company Size**
   - Grouped data analytics roles by `job_title` and `company_size`.
   - Calculated the number of positions and summarized salary details for each combination.
   - Additionally, aggregated by company size alone to show total positions and salary details.
   - Exported the results to  CSV files.
